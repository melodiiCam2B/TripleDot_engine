## Triple DOT!engine

Triple DOT is a FNF Engine mainly focused on optimization and improvement

**Our Aims:**

```yaml
1. To be beginer friendly. ease of use for both players and modders.
  we plan to be an easy to learn engine like psych engine,
  with more complicated features such as CodeName ENgine.
2. Smoother gameplay. I (Melodii2b) as a rhythm gamer,
  always had issues with the input systems, thus I aim to fix that.
  Not everyone will like the changes, so we'll provide a plethora of input systems
3. Triple DOT!engine will be as accessable as possible in due time.
